### Setting up a database instance

For this Tech Challenge, we will be using Postgres running in a docker container as our database.
This has already been configured for you using a docker-compose file. To start the data base, run
the following:

```bassh
make db_up
```

## Tech Challenge Assignment

### Summary

For this Tech Challenge, you will create a web API that exposes endpoints that read from and write
to a database that represents a fictional college and contains courses and people.

### Web Framework

You have the freedom to build this API with whatever tool you would like. With that being said, you
are strongly encouraged to use the standard library and/or chi where possible.

### Data

The data for this project lives inside of the database we created in the
previous section. As part of this Tech Challenge, you will need to access this data.

Please note that you will need to establish relationships between each table in order to complete
this challenge.

### Project Structure

Your project will need to define three routes, one each for `courses` and `person`. Each route will
need to include handlers for `get all`, `get by id`, `update by id`, `add`, and `delete` actions.

You should follow idiomatic go principles for your project. This includes project structure, code
organization, and naming conventions.

Your final product should include the web server, a dockerfile, and integration for that docker file
in the provided docker compose. You should also update the makefile with any needed commands to get
your app running. In addition, any documentation that an outside developer would need to get your
app up and running should be included.

Bellow are further details for each endpoint.

## Project Requirements Checklist

- [ ] Your API should use port `8000`.
- [ ] Your API should have a single entry point.
- [ ] Each endpoint should return the appropriate statues code with each response.
- [ ] If an error is encountered by the application, an informative error message should be returned
  to the client and your application should also log details.
- [ ] Your project should include unit tests with 80% unit test coverage.
